### üí° Overview

The tutorial uses the Python programs in [`walkthroughs/`](walkthroughs) and [`audioutil/`](audio_util), leveraging libraries like NumPy, wave, Librosa, Pydub, and matplotlib for creating .wav audio files, dumping/visualization of audio samples.

The C++ version of [ShowFloatRanges](cpp/ShowFloatRanges) is from initial drafts of this tutorial before it was moved to Python for accessibility and ease of demonstration. The C++ dump ranges is here fwiw but not mentioned in the tutorial video.
